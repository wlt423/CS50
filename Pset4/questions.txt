0.  BMP +4 billion
    GIF 256 colors
    JPEG 16.7 million colors
    PNG  16.7 million colors
    
1.  GIF

2.  When uncompressed files compressed with lossless compression retain all of their original data.  Lossy compression loses some of the data in the compression process,
thus sacrificing a certain amount of quality for compression.

3.  JPEG

4.  The directory entry in the FAT is changed for the file, and the files FAT clusters are moved to a free list.
The actual file is not changed, only the "pointer" to it.

5.  Overwrite the information with a sanitization tool.

6.  A header that provides typedefs that specify exact width integer types, as well as min and max values for ach type.

7.  You can use these specifications to make a program more portable across architectures, because the memory usage of a particular variable is fixed at a certain length.

8.  BYTE    1 byte
    DWORD   4 bytes
    LONG    4 bytes
    WORD    2 bytes
    This assumes a standard 32 but architecture.  Word lenght can vary depending on the architecture, hence the use of the above typedefs.
    
9.  bfType of 19778 or 0x424d in hex

10. bfSize is the size of the file, whereas biSize is the size of BITMAPINFOHEADER.

11. If biHeight is negative, the bmp is top down with the origin at the top left hand corner.

12. biBitCount

13. It will return NULL if the file could not be succesfully opened; this may happen if the operating system is out of memory or 
if we lack the proper permissions to open the file.

14. So that it reads one element at a time, in our case a struct.

15. 3 bytes

16. Fseek moves to specific place in the file.

17. This is the offset relative to the current position that the fseek function uses.
